shiny_pick_CABG_hospital
========================

This is the source code for my shiny app, located on https://thfrwn.shinyapps.io/shiny_pick_CABG_hospital. It uses data from the open health data of New York State to compare the performance in CABG surgery of hospitals. The number of cases, observed mortality rate, and risk-adjusted mortality rate are displayed as a histogram, superimposed by a line representing the selected hospital.

The source of the dataset and further information are displayed by the shiny app.
